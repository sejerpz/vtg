#Vala Toys for gEdit Documentation

= Introduction =

The scope of Vtg is to support the programmer at best during teh development of a Vala application.

To do it Vtg gives to the developer a list of tied integrated tools to use like _bracket or symbol completion_ and enhance the gEdit editor with some function like _quick file or method picker_.

Also it tries to minimize the use of mouse during the development.

To be clear: at the moment _vala toys_ it's *not* a finished product nor in a 0.1 version shape, but I hope it will be soon.

This page documents what Vtg _already_ can do and these will be all the features included in version 0.1. What reamins to do is a lot of refactoring and code cleanups a lot of bug fixing and minor architectural enhancements.
