#Vala Toys for gEdit Documentation

= Introduction =

The scope of Vtg is to support the programmer at best during teh development of a Vala application.

To do it Vtg gives to the developer a list of tied integrated tools to use like _bracket or symbol completion_ and enhance the gEdit editor with some function like _quick file or method picker_.

Also it tries to minimize the use of mouse during the development.

To be clear: at the moment _vala toys_ it's *not* a finished product nor in a 0.1 version shape, but I hope it will be soon.

This page documents what Vtg _already_ can do and these will be all the features included in version 0.1. What reamins to do is a lot of refactoring and code cleanups a lot of bug fixing and minor architectural enhancements.

== Project Manager ==

Vtg supports autotools project with the help of the gnome build framework (aka libgbf) library, the same actually used by the Anjuta IDE.

It doesn't expose to the user of the libgbf's functionalities, so you still have to edit Makefiles.am or configure.ac scripts by hand. This is intentional and wouldn't change unless libgbf will support better the specific bits of Vala in the autotool workflow.

=== Opening a project ===

You can select a project with the menu item File -> Open project...
